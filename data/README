* Context
The original dataset contains information on user preference data from 73,516 users on 12,294 anime. Each user is able to add anime to their completed list and give it a rating and this data set is a compilation of those ratings. This dataset has been organized and reduced by Arthur Fortes [1], which generated new IDs for users and items, separated in files the information of history and ratings and randomly selected a subsample of 5,000 users. 

The reduced was made with Python [2] with random.seed(123).
